## Contributing

Currently if you find bugs or typos, I request you to create an issue first, instead of a Pull request. 
That is the best way to contribute to this repo in it's current state.

I may not get time to review every pull request, unless you are bringing in significant improvement that would have probably taken me weeks to do it myself, I may not be able to take time out of development to review it and don't take closing pull request personally. It's just that I currently don't have time.

Thank you for understanding.
